# HypixelAutocomplete

This is a [ChatTriggers](https://github.com/ChatTriggers/ctjs/) module for versions 1.19.4 and above.

## Features

This module adds suggestion to some of the most used commands in Hypixel, here are some examples.

#### Suggestions for some Skyblock commands

The data used to autocomplete this command came from the [NotEnoughUpdates-REPO](https://github.com/NotEnoughUpdates/NotEnoughUpdates-REPO) repository on github.

It might not be 100% accurate!

You will be told when there's an error, of course!

#### Suggestions for global Hypixel commands

This data came from [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/PyICoder/08915a37d0465608ef8d67f21c4015e6/raw/205b556d724858a7a5a1fae49d5896451f0ad6c8/play%20commands.txt), again, I do not know if it's 100% accurate.

#### Suggestions for the Housing gamemode

### HypixelAutocomplete command

You can do `/hypixelautocomplete apply <housing|global|skyblock>` to forcefully apply the suggestions to the command if it hasn't autodetected anything.

## Notes

This is missing a lot of commands. Probably. Most likely. If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, contact me on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@srock_:matrix.org) or `srockw` on Discord.
